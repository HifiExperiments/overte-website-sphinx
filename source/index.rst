2023-04-01 New website
----------------------

Since our old 11ty based website was unmaintained and no one knew how to edit it, we created a brand spanking new website using Sphinx, the same system that we have been using for our main documentation for years now.
This also allows us, among other things, to finally translate the website to different languages using Weblate.

If you would like to help translate this website or other parts of Overte, head over to `weblate.overte.org ðŸ”— <https://weblate.overte.org/>`_.
