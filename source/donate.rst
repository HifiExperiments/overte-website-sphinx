Hosting, development, maintenance, and administration are a lot of work and require us to pay a not insignificant amount of money.
Donations are, next to membership fees, the only income that we have to pay our bills.

If you would like to support Overte and its development, consider donating.

You may donate via the following methods in order of preference:

- `OpenCollective ðŸ”— <https://opencollective.com/overte>`_ â€“ Bank transfer (preferred), Debit card, Credit card
- `Stripe ðŸ”— <https://donate.stripe.com/28o8xXbZC9uS7RecMM>`_ â€“ Almost any payment method you can think of
- `PayPal ðŸ”— <https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=GJPDZP47RG34E>`_

.. note::
    As a recognized non-profit, the Overte e.V. can issue receipts that are tax-deductible in Germany. Contact us at accounting@overte.org after donating, to request such a receipt.
